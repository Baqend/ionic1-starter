#Ionic and Baqend Starter

With this Ionic and Baqend starter kit you can build **blazingly fast hybrid apps** in no time.

This starter is based on the [Ionic-Tabs-Starter](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-starter-tabs).

#HOWTO

The easiest way to use this starter is to use the ionic cli:
 
 ```bash

 ```
 
 To connect your ionic app to your Baqend instance change the variable _appName_ in the _service.js_ to the name of your Baqend instance. If you will use your app on iOS please
 replace _app-starter_ with your Baqend instance name at the bottom ot the _config.xml_.
